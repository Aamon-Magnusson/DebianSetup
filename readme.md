# Debian Dotfiles

My main dot files are meant for Arch systems, and some of the dependencies are a little messy on other systems.

This repo is not intended to be my "home" dotfiles, just to make a Debian system feel like home if I need to.

I know this works on rolling debian distros, like Kali.
Static releases may take more tweaking.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/DebianSetup
cd DebianSetup
./setup.sh
```

This setup script will clone my main dotfiles repo and take what it can.

Changes are intended to be made in the repo, I will not be making a fetch script.
